# Balda Architecture Map

Use this map to find the authoritative runtime contracts.

## Documents

- [Runtime contract](runtime-contract.md)
- [JetStream actorlayer adapter](jetstream-command-bus.md)
- [Actor runtime](actor-runtime.md)
- [Norma actorlayer contract boundary](actor-runtime.md#norma-actorlayer-contract-boundaries)
- [Projections and read models](projections-and-read-models.md)
- [Reliability](reliability.md)
- [Testing and evals](testing-and-evals.md)

## Invariants

- JetStream is the only concrete command/event transport, exposed to Balda runtime code through actorlayer abstractions.
- SQLite is product/read-model state, not a command queue.
- Ingress handlers dispatch actor envelopes through `swarm.ActorDispatcher`; actors execute commands.
- Actor execution contract is split: core actor mechanics in Norma; Balda owns product actors, the configured provider runtime, JetStream adapter policy, and all queue/retry/dead-letter policy.

## Runtime Flow

Telegram/webhook/scheduler ingress -> `ActorDispatcher` -> NATS adapter -> actorlayer `Source`/`Delivery` -> Norma dispatch runtime -> Balda product actor -> event projection/status.
